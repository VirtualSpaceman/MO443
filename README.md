# MO443 - Introduction to Digital Image Processing
Introduction to Digital Image Processing

Repo for course MO443, with all practical assignments developed for the course.

Uses [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/), [Scikit-Image](https://scikit-image.org/), and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).


## Structure
Inside every ``Project-X`` folder there are:

- A [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) containing the main code for reproducing the results obtained; 
- ``image`` folder where you can put an specific image in there and run all experiments; 
- ``output`` folder where all intermediate and finals results are saved; 
- Report on the project, with result analysis and some discussion (written in Portuguese).


## Projects

- **Project 1**: Getting familiar with basic image pressing concepts, such as: image resolution, quantization and gray level transformations; 
- **Project 2**: Undestanding the concepts of High, low and band-pass filters applied on images through convolution operation; 
- **Project 3**: Fast Fourier transform([FFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform)) for image compression and filtering (high, low and band-pass);
- **Project 4**: Applying [Mathematical Morphology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_morphology) for segmenting a document image into text and non-text components;
- **Project 5**: Panorama Formation using Image Stitching.


Course Given by [Prof. HÃ©lio Pedrini](https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~helio/).
